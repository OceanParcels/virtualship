    "\n",
    "- You will write a popular scientific article about the virtual expedition. \n",
    "    - This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "    - The length of the article should be between 400 and 700 words. \n",
    "    - The audience of your science communication article are Physics BSc students.\n",
    "    - You need to include and refer to the findings/results of at least two scientific articles as background.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For examples of the style you could use, check out [this article](https://physicsworld.com/a/20000-pings-under-the-sea/) (although at almost 3,000 words that article is way longer than expected here), or [this article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/to-hades-and-back-exploring-the-deepest-part-of-the-ocean/).\n",
    "    - You are allowed to use Generative AI to create photos of the expedition (but only for photos; no other uses of Generative AI are allowed!) \n",
    "- Submit a first draft of the article to Blackboard by 27 March 17:00. \n",
    "- Every student will provide formative feedback for two  other articles. Deadline is 2 April 17:00. This formative feedback will be graded and will count 25% of the mark for this assignment. \n",
    "- You will incorporate the formative feedback where appropriate into a final version of the article and submit that as a pdf on Blackboard by 5 April.\n",
    "- The articles will be graded by the lecturer and the Teaching Assistants\n"
