    "Congratulations on receiving an early career research grant for ship time on a scientific research vessel! This achievement is a testament to your hard work and commitment to advancing marine science. The opportunity will undoubtedly enhance your research and contribute significantly to our understanding of marine science.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have access to the ship for a three-week period—a duration identified as a favorable trade-off between research time and ensuring an enjoyable vessel experience. Your vessel will be equipped with two vessel-mounted ADCPs, a CTD, and can collect underway data of temperature and salinity from 2 meters below the hull of the ship. In addition, you can deploy up to 30 Argo floats and/or 30 surface drifters. A detailed plan of your route, timing and required instruments needs to be sent in for approval/grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a taste of what it’s like to board a real vessel, you'll find some general information that is shared with all cruise participants **/LINK/Here**. You might also like to watch the video clip about life onboard the Research Vessel Southern Surveyor: [Life Onboard RV Southern Surveyor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUI0TA-gCK0)."

But **/LINK/** here’s a list of interesting regions or phenomena to spark your imagination and you’ll get an opportunity to be in contact with experienced oceanographers.  \n",

    "We’ve prepared some exercises to help you get familiar with the type of data that will be collected by the research vessel. You will be graded on your answers below. But first let’s give you some more information on the different scientific instruments.  "

A lead time of roughly one year should be considered for regular proposals. The lead time for larger expeditions is about one and a half to two years minimum. \n",

Work in difficult areas (for example where there is piracy and the risk of war) must be refrained from. "
