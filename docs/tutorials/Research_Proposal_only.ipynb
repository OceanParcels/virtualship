    "Congratulations on receiving an early career research grant for ship time on a scientific research vessel! This achievement is a testament to your hard work and commitment to advancing marine science. The opportunity will undoubtedly enhance your research and contribute significantly to our understanding of marine science.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have access to the ship for a three-week period—a duration identified as a favorable trade-off between research time and ensuring an enjoyable vessel experience. Your vessel will be equipped with two vessel-mounted ADCPs, a CTD, and can collect underway data of temperature and salinity from 2 meters below the hull of the ship. In addition, you can deploy up to 30 Argo floats and/or 30 surface drifters. A detailed plan of your route, timing and required instruments needs to be sent in for approval/grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a taste of what it’s like to board a real vessel, you'll find some general information that is shared with all cruise participants  <a href=\"https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/Kmu00cNvw4d8FBs\" style=\"color:red;\">here</a>.\n",

It operates based on the principle of Doppler shift, where sound waves emitted by the instrument are reflected off moving particles in the water, such as plankton or sediment, and the frequency shift of the returning waves is used to calculate the velocity of the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy the ADCP on transects and choose between a shallow profiler capable of providing information to a depth of 150 m every 4 meters (the 300kHz seaSeven), or a long-range profiler capable of providing about 1000m of range every 24 meters (the 38kHz Ocean Observer). You may assume it doesn’t take any time to start or end ADCP measurements.\n",
